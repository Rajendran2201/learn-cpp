## Operators in Cpp

C++ divides the operators into the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators


- String concatenation operator (+) 
  - string concatenation can also be done using the append method 

Let's look at an example 

```c++

string firstName = "Neha";
string lastName = "Sharma";

cout << firstName.append(lastName);

```
